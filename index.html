      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="icon">💡</div>
      <p>
        My journey into tech began with curiosity and a determination to teach
        myself HTML and CSS. That spark grew into a career path when I joined
        the FNB App Academy, a 9-week full-stack development bootcamp, where I
        gained hands-on experience in building real-world projects, solving
        complex problems, and working in agile teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eager to expand my capabilities, I enrolled at Oracle University, where
        I’m pursuing the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Professional
        Developer certification. This has opened the door to mastering cloud
        computing and learning how to design, build, and deploy secure, scalable
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, I’m pursuing a BA in Development Studies, with the
        long-term goal of transitioning into an Honours degree in IT. My mission
        is simple: keep learning, keep building, and keep stacking the skills
        and qualifications that will make me a world-class Software Engineer.

      <h2>My Tech Journey</h2>
      <div class="icon">🚀</div>
      <p>
        My love for technology began with curiosity — the kind that had me
        staying up late, tinkering with code, and teaching myself the basics of
        HTML and CSS. That spark grew into something bigger when I joined the
        FNB App Academy, a 9-week full-stack development bootcamp. Those weeks
        were a whirlwind of real-world problem-solving, building projects I was
        proud of, and collaborating in agile teams that pushed me to think
        faster and smarter.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I wasn’t done. I wanted to go beyond building apps and learn how to
        create scalable solutions that could live in the cloud. That’s what led
        me to Oracle University, where I’m currently enrolled in the Oracle
        Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Professional Developer program. Here, I’m
        diving into the world of cloud computing, sharpening my skills to
        design, build, and deploy secure, high-performing applications — ready
        to solve real-world challenges on a global scale.

          <h3>My Journey Through the FNB App Academy Bootcamp</h3>
          <p class="blog-date">July 25, 2025</p>
          <div class="blog-post-content">
            <div class="blog-post-preview">
              <p>
                From my very first "Hello World" to building full-stack
                applications in just 9 weeks, the FNB App Academy bootcamp was a
                life-changing experience. It showed me that with focus and
                persistence, I can learn and create anything I set my mind to.

            <div class="blog-post-full">
              <p>
                My journey into coding officially began at the FNB App Academy
                bootcamp, a 9-week intensive program that opened the doors to
                full-stack development. From the very first moment I ran "Hello
                World," I knew I had fallen in love with coding. It was exciting
                to see something I typed on the screen come to life.
              </p>
              <p>
                The program was fast-paced, covering a wide range of skills in a
                short amount of time. Within weeks, we went from writing simple
                HTML and CSS pages to tackling JavaScript and Python projects.
                The amount of information packed into those 9 weeks was
                overwhelming at times, but also incredibly rewarding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Debugging became one of my favorite parts of the process. Every
                error message was a challenge waiting to be solved, and each
                solution brought a sense of accomplishment. Watching my web apps
                evolve with every fix and new feature made me realize how
                powerful coding really is.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through the bootcamp, I learned the importance of persistence,
                problem-solving, and collaboration. More than just the technical
                knowledge, I gained confidence in my ability to grow as a
                developer. It taught me that learning never stops and that I am
                capable of mastering any skill I put my mind to.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will always be grateful to FNB and IT Varsity for giving me
                this opportunity. Their support and guidance set the foundation
                for my career in tech, and I’m excited to keep building,
                learning, and creating as I continue my journey as a full-stack
                developer.

          <h3>My Experience at the Johannesburg Amazon Summit 2025</h3>
          <p class="blog-date">August 22, 2025</p>
          <div class="blog-post-content">
            <div class="blog-post-preview">
              <p>
                Attending the Amazon Summit in Johannesburg was an eye-opening
                experience. Although I registered as a student and was limited
                to the student zone, it gave me a new perspective on the tech
                community and the value of networking in the industry.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-post-full">
              <p>
                The Johannesburg Amazon Summit 2025 was my first major tech
                conference, and I was excited to dive into the world of cloud,
                innovation, and networking. However, when registering I
                mistakenly signed up as a student, which meant I wasn’t allowed
                into the main building where the core sessions were happening.
                Instead, I was placed in the student zone — a space designed
                more for introductory exposure than in-depth learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                At first, I was a little disappointed because I felt like I was
                missing out on the deeper technical sessions, but the experience
                still had its own value. I connected with other students and
                young developers who were also starting their journeys in tech.
                It became more of a social experience, and through conversations
                I gained insights into different learning paths, struggles, and
                opportunities others were exploring.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being surrounded by so many like-minded people gave me a new
                appreciation for the importance of community in tech. It
                reminded me that growth doesn’t just come from workshops or
                certifications — it also comes from sharing experiences, asking
                questions, and building relationships.
              </p>
              <p>
                While I didn’t get the full summit experience I had hoped for,
                it was still an important milestone for me. It made me realize
                how important it is to take every opportunity seriously — even
                small details like how you register. Next time, I’ll make sure
                to sign up properly so I can attend the main sessions and absorb
                as much knowledge as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most importantly, the summit sparked a fire in me to keep
                showing up in spaces like these. Even if things don’t go as
                planned, every experience has something to teach, and this one
                taught me to always stay curious and intentional about my growth
                in tech.

          <h3>Building Lorraine's Restaurant Web App</h3>
          <p class="blog-date">August 13, 2025</p>
          <div class="blog-post-content">
            <div class="blog-post-preview">
              <p>
                Lorraine's Restaurant web app has been one of my most exciting
                projects — from building a beautiful menu layout to adding real
                functionality like bookings, ordering, and a working cart
                system. It challenged me to grow as both a front-end and
                back-end developer.
              </p>
            </div>
            <button class="read-more-btn">Read More</button>
            <button class="read-less-btn">Read Less</button>
            <div class="blog-post-full">
              <p>
                When I started building Lorraine's Restaurant, my goal was
                simple: create a visually appealing site where users could
                browse the menu and book a table. But as the project grew, I
                realized I wanted to push myself further and bring in real-world
                functionality like filtering menu items, customizing orders, and
                persisting cart data.
              </p>
              <p>
                The front-end came first: designing the homepage, setting up the
                restaurant’s story, and styling the menu sections. I wanted
                users to feel like they were stepping into a real restaurant
                space, so I focused on details like smooth navigation,
                scrollable category tabs, and animations that made the
                experience interactive.
              </p>
              <p>
                The real challenge came when I started implementing the logic. I
                worked on:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A booking form that validates input and allows users to
                  reserve tables.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A cart system with quantity increment/decrement, remove
                  buttons, and localStorage persistence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A menu customization modal where users can add notes before
                  sending items to the cart.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Smooth scrolling between menu categories for better
                  navigation.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Debugging became a huge part of the journey — from fixing a
                stubborn hamburger menu that wouldn’t behave on mobile, to
                ensuring that cart totals updated dynamically every time an
                order changed. Each solved bug felt like a small victory, and it
                reminded me why I enjoy coding so much.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I love most about this project is how it represents the
                blend of creativity and problem-solving. It wasn’t just about
                making things look good, but about making them work in a way
                that feels natural and easy for users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lorraine’s Restaurant taught me how to think like a user, write
                cleaner JavaScript, and structure my files better for
                scalability. It’s still a work in progress, but each update
                brings me closer to building a full-stack app that feels
                production-ready.
